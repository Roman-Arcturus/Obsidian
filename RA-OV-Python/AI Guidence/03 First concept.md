# Phase 3 — First Concept: Names and Binding (We Do This Together)
### Why this one first

Because it underpins:
- mutation
- closures
- default arguments
- argument passing
- loop behavior

Nothing else should be written before this.

## What I Need From You Now

Do **only** this before replying:
1. Create the vault
2. Create the folders
3. Create the five empty concept notes
4. Create the meta rules note

Then reply with:

> “Phase 0–2 complete. Ready to fill the first concept.”

From that point on, I will guide every note line-by-line until the system is stable.
