1. Pattern Name and Intent


```
# [Pattern Name]

## Intent

[State the purpose of the pattern: what problem it solves or what goal it achieves, without describing implementation yet.]

```

### Explanation

- Focus on **why this pattern exists**, not how to implement it.
    
- Connect immediately to the underlying **concept(s)**.
    

_Stop here. Confirm with:_

> “Section 1 accepted. Continue.”

---

## 2. Concepts Involved
```
## Concepts Involved

[List the core concepts that this pattern relies on (e.g., Names and Binding, Mutation vs Transformation, Scope vs Lifetime, etc.)]

```

### Explanation

- Helps **map concepts to patterns** for mental clarity.
    
- Reinforces why the pattern works.
    

_Stop here. Confirm with:_

> “Section 2 accepted. Continue.”

---

## 3. Problem Description
```
## Problem Description

[Describe the recurring problem or pain point this pattern addresses. Explain why the problem exists conceptually.]

```

### Explanation

- Focus on **reasoning and pain points**, not code.
    
- Links the pattern directly to mental models and observable Python behavior.
    

_Stop here. Confirm with:_

> “Section 3 accepted. Continue.”

---

## 4. Solution

```
## Solution

[Provide the conceptual solution. Explain strategies, principles, or step-by-step reasoning before introducing code. Emphasize safety, clarity, and Pythonic style.]

```

### Explanation

- Translate **concepts into strategies**.
    
- Avoid code until reasoning is fully understood.
    
- Show **how the pattern mitigates the problem**.
    

_Stop here. Confirm with:_

> “Section 4 accepted. Continue.”

## 5. When to Use / When Not to Use

```
## When to Use

[List conditions or scenarios where applying this pattern is beneficial.]

## When Not to Use

[List scenarios where the pattern would introduce unnecessary complexity or risk.]

```

### Explanation

- Defines **boundaries for safe application**.
    
- Encourages conscious trade-offs.
    

_Stop here. Confirm with:_

> “Section 5 accepted. Continue.”

---

## 6. Links
```
## Links

### Concepts
[List the core concepts this pattern depends on.]

### Patterns
[List related patterns that complement or build on this one.]

### Examples
[List example notes that illustrate the pattern in practice.]

```

### Explanation

- Fully integrates the pattern into your **vault graph**.
    
- Prepares the way for **examples** to reinforce mental models.
    

_Step complete._

With this template, your vault is now fully prepared to continue **concept → pattern → example** learning in a highly structured, repeatable way.

If you like, I can also prepare a **ready-to-paste example note template** for when we eventually create disposable, executable Python illustrations. This would complete the full vault workflow.

Do you want me to do that as well?
