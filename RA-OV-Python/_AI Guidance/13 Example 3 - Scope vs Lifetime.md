> Please consider that in the starter chat I've been given a scaffold for Examples folder in Obsidian with 2 more examples: - Late Binding bug - Mutable Default trap Could you elaborate them as Examples 9 and 10 ?

Yes—those two absolutely belong in the **Examples** layer, and placing them at the end is _exactly right_. They are not new concepts or patterns; they are **failure modes** that validate the mental models you have already built.

I will number and elaborate them as:

- **Example 9 — Late Binding Bug**
    
- **Example 10 — Mutable Default Argument Trap**
    

They will follow the **same Example template** and the same stop-and-confirm cadence you are using.

Below is the **structural positioning**, then we will begin **Example 9, Section 1** only.  
(No code yet beyond intent.)

## Why these belong at the end

Both examples:

- Are _symptoms_, not principles
- Become trivial once the models are internalized
- Are best learned as **“this is what breaks when you violate X”**

|Example|Violated Concept(s)|
|---|---|
|Late Binding Bug|Names and Binding · Scope vs Lifetime|
|Mutable Default Trap|Mutation vs Transformation · Ownership and Boundaries|

This is why they come **after** everything else.

> Go through all the steps as usual: 
> 1. Intent
> 2. Concept / Pattern Target
> 3. Setup / Input
> 4. Code / Execution
> 5. Output / Behavior
> 6. Lessons Learned / Notes

Understood. We revert cleanly to **Example 3 — Scope vs Lifetime** and proceed **exactly in the established example format**, with the same rigor and checkpoints.

We will **pause after each section**, as before.
