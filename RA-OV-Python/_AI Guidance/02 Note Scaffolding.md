Below is a **clear, disciplined execution plan** to create the new Obsidian vault and begin populating it **from zero**, without importing conceptual noise from your old notes.

I will be explicit, slow, and structural. Do not skip steps.

---
## Phase 0 — Vault Creation (Do This First, Nothing Else)

### What it is

You are creating a **concept-indexed vault**, not a notebook.

### Why it’s useful

Starting clean prevents subconscious re-creation of chronological structure.

### Unified mental model

> The vault is a **map of laws**, not a diary of travel.

### Concrete steps

1. Create a new Obsidian vault  
    **Name:**  
    `Python – Mental Models`
    
2. Create exactly these top-level folders:

```
/Concepts 
/Patterns 
/Cheat Sheets 
/Examples 
/_Meta
```

3. Do **not** add templates yet.  
    Do **not** import old notes.  
    Do **not** install plugins.

Stop here. Confirm when done.

## Phase 1 — Establish the Concept Spine (Foundational)

You will now create **five concept notes only**. These are the non-negotiable backbone.

### Concept 1: `Names and Binding`

**File:**  
`/Concepts/Names and Binding.md`

Insert **only** the following structure (no examples yet):

```
# Names and Binding  
## What it is  
## Why it’s useful  
## Unified mental model  
## Consequences  
## Common misconceptions  
## Links
```

Do not write content yet. This is scaffolding.

---
### Concept 2: `Mutation vs Transformation`

**File:**  
`/Concepts/Mutation vs Transformation.md`

Same structure as above.

---
### Concept 3: `Scope vs Lifetime`

**File:**  
`/Concepts/Scope vs Lifetime.md`

Same structure.

---
### Concept 4: `Identity vs Equality`

**File:**  
`/Concepts/Identity vs Equality.md`

Same structure.

---
### Concept 5: `Ownership and Boundaries`

**File:**  
`/Concepts/Ownership and Boundaries.md`

Same structure.

---
### Why we are doing it this way

- Writing structure before content **prevents rambling**
- You are committing to a **fixed conceptual surface area**
- These notes must survive years; discipline now matters
### Unified mental model

> Concepts are defined before they are explained.

---

## Phase 2 — Meta Guardrails (Prevent Vault Decay)

Create one meta note.
### File

`/_Meta/Rules of This Vault.md`

Paste this verbatim:
```
# Rules of This Vault

1. Concepts are rare and stable.
2. Patterns apply one or more concepts.
3. Examples are disposable.
4. No chronological notes.
5. Every new note must link upward.
6. If something doesn’t fit, the model is incomplete — not the vault.
```
This file exists to stop future you from sabotaging present you.

Once the structure exists, we will **fill exactly one concept completely**, slowly and rigorously.
