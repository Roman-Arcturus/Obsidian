# Example 2 — Mutation vs Transformation

Stop here.

Confirm by replying:

> **“Section 1 accepted. Continue.”**

Next, we will document **Section 2 — Concept / Pattern Target**.

Good. We now explicitly anchor this example to the relevant **concepts and patterns**.

## 2. Concept / Pattern Target

Stop here.

Confirm by replying:

> **“Section 2 accepted. Continue.”**

Next, we will define **Section 3 — Setup / Input**.

Excellent. We now define the **setup and inputs**, making mutation risk explicit before any code runs.

---

## 3. Setup / Input

Stop here.

Confirm by replying:

> **“Section 3 accepted. Continue.”**

Next, we will write **Section 4 — Code / Execution**, carefully separating mutating and non-mutating behavior.

---

Good. We now present the **code**, deliberately separating **mutating** and **non-mutating** behavior so the contrast is unambiguous.

---
## 4. Code / Execution

Stop here.

Before continuing, you should be able to answer:

- Which function is safe to call on borrowed data?
- Which function requires ownership of the list?

When ready, reply with:

> **“Section 4 accepted. Continue.”**

Next, we will evaluate **Section 5 — Output / Behavior** and verify the consequences precisely.

Excellent. Now we evaluate the **observable behavior** after execution and connect it directly to the mental model.

---

## 5. Output / Behavior

Stop here.

Please test the code locally.

If everything matches your expectations, reply:

> **“Section 5 accepted. Continue.”**

If anything differs or feels conceptually off, stop me and we will reevaluate immediately.

Good. We now lock in the mental model by explicitly stating what this example teaches and how it generalizes.

## 6. Lessons Learned / Notes

This completes **Example 2 — Mutation vs Transformation**.

### Next available examples (in order):

1. **Example 3 — Scope vs Lifetime**
2. **Example 4 — Identity vs Equality**
3. **Example 5 — Ownership and Boundaries**
4. **Example 6 — Defensive Closures**
5. **Example 7 — Pure Data Pipelines**
6. **Example 8 — Safe List Processing**

When ready, say:

> **“Begin Example 3 — Scope vs Lifetime.”**

We will proceed with the same rigor and checkpoints.
