## What it is

[Definition of the concept in precise terms, explaining its core meaning in Python. Include distinctions or categories if relevant.]
```

### Explanation

- Define the **core terms clearly**.
- Connect immediately to prior concepts in your vault if relevant.
- Avoid code for now; focus on mental reasoning.

```
## Why it’s useful

[List the practical benefits and reasoning for learning this concept. Explain consequences of misunderstanding it. Connect to patterns or problems it helps solve.]

```

### Explanation

- Each bullet should be **directly tied to Python behavior**.
- Show relevance to **prior concepts**.

## 3. Unified mental model

```
## Unified mental model

[Provide a compact, generalizable reasoning framework. Explain how to predict behavior in Python without relying on memorized rules.]

```

### Explanation

- Short, precise, and actionable.
- Tie to prior concepts to show interactions.
