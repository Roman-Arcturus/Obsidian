## 1. Set vs list — one real-life distinction only

### What they are (minimal)

- **list** → ordered sequence, position matters   [ ]
- **set** → membership collection, position does not exist    { }

---

### Real-life mental model (use exactly this)

- **list** → _queue / checklist_
    - “first”, “second”, “third”
    - duplicates allowed
    - “give me item #2”
    
- **set** → _access control / whitelist_
    - “is this allowed?”
    - duplicates meaningless
    - “is X present?”

If you find yourself asking **“is this in here?”**, a set is usually the correct model.

That is all you need _for now_.

The “queue vs whitelist” distinction worked because:
- It maps to **intent**, not implementation
- It answers _“when would I reach for this?”_
- It reduces cognitive load
