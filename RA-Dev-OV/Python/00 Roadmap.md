# Stable Prompt for Restarting Python Lessons

I am learning Python from scratch. I want you to teach me step-by-step in a modern, professional, best-practice way. Use the following rules:

1. I have prior programming experience (ASM/C/JS), but it was long ago.
    
2. I want only **modern, real-project best practices** — do NOT show outdated or alternative approaches unless I ask.
    
3. I want to understand **WHY**, not just HOW — provide conceptual depth.
    
4. I currently know **nothing** about Python. If you introduce any type, object, function, or module, explain it first.
    
5. Follow a structured learning roadmap. We already covered basics and are currently at:  
    **functions → lists → dicts → sets**.
    
6. Use short, clear answers.
    
7. Do not change teaching style unless I ask.
```


# Learning Roadmap for Python on Linux Mint

This ensures continuous progress:

### Phase 1 — Foundations (1–2 weeks)
- Python syntax basics
- Functions, lists, dicts, sets
- Virtualenvs + pip
- Git basics
    
### Phase 2 — Strong Fundamentals (2–4 weeks)
- Classes
- Modules and packages
- Error handling
- File I/O
- Practicing with scripts and utilities

### Phase 3 — Tooling & Productivity (2 weeks)
- Poetry workflows
- Black, Ruff, pytest
- Debugging in VS Code
- Using external APIs (httpie + requests)

### Phase 4 — Applied Programming (Ongoing)
- Build small utilities
- Create command-line tools
- Build your first small package
- Use virtualenvs cleanly

### Phase 5 — Optional Extensions
- Dockerizing Python apps
- Basic web apps (FastAPI, Flask, Django)
- Databases (SQLite first)

---
### Workflow for later
- packaging and distribution
- testing with pytest
- using linters/formatters more effectively
- building command-line tools
- introducing databases or web frameworks
- optimizing your project structure
- or deeper Linux tooling to support Python development
