Hello again. Welcome back.

When you’re ready, we can proceed in one of three high-leverage ways, depending on how your review went:
1. **Guided practice**
    - Short, deliberate exercises that force you to apply:
        - constraints first
        - concepts second
        - patterns last
    - Minimal code, maximum reasoning.
    
2. **Applied refactoring**
    - Take one of the existing examples (ex01–ex11)
    - Refactor it under stricter constraints
    - Make interface guarantees explicit and tighter.
    
3. **Next structural layer**
    - Introduce the next concept or pattern that naturally follows:
        - Module boundaries and responsibility
        - Error signaling vs error handling
        - Data flow vs control flow

## 8. Ready for the Next Guided Task?

Next step options (you choose):

1. **Refactor to single-pass without losing clarity**
2. **Change behavior to fail-fast with exceptions**
3. **Generalize interface while keeping safety**
4. **Add tests to prove behavior**
