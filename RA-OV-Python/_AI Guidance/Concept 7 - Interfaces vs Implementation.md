> Please choose the option that is best suited to my current understanding.

Given your current understanding:

- You have now **five concepts**, **four constraints**, **three patterns**, and **ten examples** fully documented.
    
- You have strong familiarity with functional-style thinking, ownership, mutation vs transformation, scope/lifetime, identity/equality, and data shape/meaning.
    
- You have not yet explicitly practiced **abstracting behavior behind interfaces**, which is essential before exploring advanced patterns or OOP.

### Recommendation

**Next:** **Concept 7 — Interfaces vs Implementation**

**Reasoning:**

1. Bridges **current concepts and constraints** with future patterns and modular design.
    
2. Prepares you for **safe OOP**, **defensive APIs**, and **well-structured pipelines**.
    
3. Introduces **abstraction** in a controlled, functional-first style, without rushing into inheritance, classes, or polymorphism.
    
4. Ensures that when you later study patterns or refactor code, you can reason clearly about **what functions/modules promise vs how they fulfill it**.
    

> Mental model: _Before changing how data is represented or processed, know exactly what contract the function or module provides._
