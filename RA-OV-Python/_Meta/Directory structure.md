| ct02 Mutation vs Transformation.md | In-place vs new-object operations, side effects |
| ct03 Scope vs Lifetime.md          | Name visibility vs object persistence, closures |
| ct04 Identity vs Equality.md       | `is` vs `==`, shared references                 |
| ct05 Ownership and Boundaries.md   | Ownership, borrowing, safe mutation             |

## Examples

|File|Topic|
|---|---|
|ex01 Names and Binding.md|Multiple names, rebinding, shallow copies|
|ex02 Mutation vs Transformation.md|Mutating vs returning transformed lists|
|ex03 Scope vs Lifetime.md|Closures preserving lifetime beyond scope|
|ex04 Identity vs Equality.md|`is` vs `==`, mutable and immutable behavior|
|ex05 Ownership and Boundaries.md|Owned vs borrowed data, safe copying|
|ex06 Defensive Closures.md|Avoiding late-binding traps|
|ex07 Pure Data Pipelines.md|Transforming lists without side effects|
|ex08 Safe List Processing.md|Controlled list mutation and copying|
|ex09 Late Binding Bug.md|Loop variables in closures, deferred name lookup|
|ex10 Mutable Default Trap.md|Mutable default arguments and unexpected sharing|

This naming scheme ensures:

1. **Consistency** across VS Code and Obsidian.
2. **Predictable ordering** for concepts, patterns, and examples.
3. **Ease of cross-linking**, as each file has a unique prefix (`ct`, `pt`, `ex`) and sequential numbering.

This prompt is now saved for reference to maintain structure, cross-linking, and consistent naming conventions when adding new notes, patterns, or examples.
