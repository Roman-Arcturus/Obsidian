# **Lambda Expressions & Key Functions**

This topic is essential because lambdas appear everywhere in real Python: sorting, filtering, transformations, callbacks, deduplication, grouping, and lightweight functional pipelines.

# 1. What It Is

A **lambda expression** in Python is an inline, anonymous function.  
It behaves like a regular function created with `def`, but:

- it has no name
- it consists of exactly one expression
- it is used where a short, one-off function is needed

Example:
```
lambda x: x * 2
```
This represents a function that takes `x` and returns `x*2`.
