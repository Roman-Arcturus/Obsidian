## 1. Intent

```
## Intent

[State what this example demonstrates: a concept, a pattern, a common pitfall, or an edge case.]

```

### Explanation

- Clarifies **why the example exists**.
- Connects directly to the concept(s) or pattern(s) it illustrates.

_Stop here. Confirm with:_

> “Section 1 accepted. Continue.”

---

## 2. Concept / Pattern Target

```
## Concept / Pattern Target

[List the concept(s) or pattern(s) this example reinforces.]

```

### Explanation

- Shows **direct mapping** between theory and practice.
    
- Reinforces mental model by linking code to abstract principles.
    

_Stop here. Confirm with:_

> “Section 2 accepted. Continue.”

---

## 3. Setup / Input

```
## Setup / Input

[Describe input types, initial values, or environment setup. Include type hints where relevant.]

```

### Explanation

- Specifies **all input assumptions** explicitly.
    
- Ensures the example is **predictable and reproducible**.
    

_Stop here. Confirm with:_

> “Section 3 accepted. Continue.”

---

## 4. Code / Execution

```
## Code / Execution

[Provide the Python code snippet. Prefer multi-line, readable formatting. Avoid hidden side effects. Use defensive defaults when possible.]

```

### Explanation

- Keep code **concise, readable, and focused** on the concept or pattern.
    
- Avoid extra features; the goal is **clarity, not complexity**.
    

_Stop here. Confirm with:_

> “Section 4 accepted. Continue.”

---

## 5. Output / Behavior

```
## Output / Behavior

[Describe the expected output, changes in state, or observed behavior. Include type information.]

```

### Explanation

- Reinforces the mental model by connecting **code to consequences**.
    
- Clarifies whether mutation, transformation, or identity issues occur.
    

_Stop here. Confirm with:_

> “Section 5 accepted. Continue.”

---

## 6. Lessons Learned / Notes

```
## Lessons Learned / Notes

[Summarize the key takeaways, pitfalls avoided, and connections to concepts or patterns.]

```

### Explanation

- Helps **solidify the mental model**.
    
- Makes the example **disposable yet meaningful**, suitable for rapid reference later.
    

_Step complete._

With this, your Obsidian vault is fully structured for:

1. **Concept notes** — theory, mental models, misconceptions, links
    
2. **Pattern notes** — application, intent, boundaries, links
    
3. **Example notes** — executable illustrations reinforcing concepts and patterns
    

You now have **templates for everything** needed to continue in exactly the same rigorous, hierarchical, concept-driven style.

If you like, I can also create a **ready-to-paste “next concept starter” with all sections pre-filled for immediate use**, so when you return you can jump straight into Section 1 of the next concept without setup.

Do you want me to do that too?
