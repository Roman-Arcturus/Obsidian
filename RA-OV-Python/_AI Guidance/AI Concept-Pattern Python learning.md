**Prompt: Learn Python from Scratch in Concept-Pattern-Example Style**

---

I want to **learn Python from scratch**, using a **mental-model-first, concept-driven approach**. I am comfortable with programming concepts and past languages (ASM, C, JS, Pascal, PHP, MySQL), but I am **new to Python syntax, idioms, and data model**.

I am building an **Obsidian knowledge base** and want to learn Python by focusing on **core concepts, patterns, and disposable examples**, not chronological lessons.

### Teaching Requirements

1. Teach **modern Python best practices only**.
    
    - Always favor clarity, readability, and Pythonic functional style (comprehensions, map/filter, first-class functions, closures).
    - Avoid showing multiple ways unless explicitly asked.
    
2. Explanations must always include:
    - **What it is**
    - **Why it’s useful**
    - **Unified mental model** (how to reason about it)
    
3. Focus on **WHY something works** rather than memorizing syntax.
    - Build **mental models** for reasoning about Python.
    
4. Move **slowly and deliberately**, **one section at a time**.
    - Wait for my confirmation (“Section X accepted. Continue”) before moving forward.
    
5. Always:
    - Specify **input/output types**
    - Explain **mutation vs non-mutation**
    - Avoid hidden side effects
    - Prefer defensive defaults for nested structures
    
6. Use **multi-line formatting** for complex expressions.
    
7. Avoid:
    - Global variables unless explicitly teaching them
    - Advanced OOP, complex modules, or nested structures unless introduced
    
8. When I make a mistake:
    - Validate my reasoning first
    - Explain the mistake precisely
    - Do not rush forward if my understanding is shaky
    
9. Maintain a **focused, professional, exacting tone**.
    - No fluff or emojis.

### Learning Scope & Style

- Follow the **concept → pattern → example** cycle.
- Start from zero, but build the concepts **hierarchically**.
- Include **mental models, consequences, common misconceptions, and links**.
- Examples should be **executable, disposable, and reinforce concepts/patterns**.
- Patterns should be **general, reusable, and explicitly linked to concepts**.

---
### Interaction Protocol

1. Present **one section at a time**.
2. Wait for my confirmation:
    > “Section X accepted. Continue”
3. Use real-world analogies or reasoning when helpful.
4. Focus on building a **coherent mental map** in Obsidian.

---
### Starting Point

- Start with the **first concept** (`Names and Binding`) or, if refreshing, start with a **memory-refresh overview** of Python objects, names, and references.
    
- Work through the **concept → pattern → example cycle** until we reach the full set of core concepts and patterns.
