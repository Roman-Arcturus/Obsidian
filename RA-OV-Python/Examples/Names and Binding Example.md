## Intent

Demonstrate how multiple names can reference the same object, how rebinding a name works, and how identity differs from value equality.

### Explanation

- Shows the **fundamental behavior of Python names as bindings**.
    
- Reinforces reasoning about shared identity, which underpins **Ownership and Boundaries**, **Mutation vs Transformation**, and **Safe List Processing**.
    
- Prepares the mental model for understanding **closures and data sharing**.

## Concept / Pattern Target

- Names and Binding  
- Identity vs Equality  
- Ownership and Boundaries

### Explanation

- **Names and Binding**: The core idea demonstrated — how names reference objects.
    
- **Identity vs Equality**: Highlights the difference between `is` (identity) and `==` (equality).
    
- **Ownership and Boundaries**: Illustrates potential ownership confusion when multiple names reference the same object.

This section ensures the example is **anchored in the mental model** rather than just being executable code.
